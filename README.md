## DrawTheNet.IO : Diagrams as code for engineers.

![Logo](docs/logo.png)

DrawTheNet.IO draws network diagrams dynamically from a text file describing the placement, layout and icons. 
Given a yaml file describing the hierarchy of the network and it's connections, a resulting diagram will be created.

# Motivation

Complex network diagrams typically involve specific place of icons, connections and labels using a tool like Visio or OmniGraffle using a mouse and constantly zooming in and out for single pixel placement. 
The goal behind drawthenet.io is to be able to describe the digram in a text file and have it rendered in SVG in the browser. 
I simply wanted to be able to draw network diagrams as fast as it could be done on a dry-erase board without using a mouse.
Also, being able to store a diagram as text makes it easy to version control and share.

# Quick start

Go to https://drawthenet.io and start creating diagrams.

# Build Instruction
## Docker Build (Prefered)

You can easily build the tool to host locally with the provided [docker file](./tools/Dockerfile)

```
cd ./tools/
docker build -t local/drawthenet.io .
```
It will build the docker image from scratch, including downloading the icons from alland you can run it with the following command:



## Local Build
You need [libvisio2svg](https://github.com/kakwa/libvisio2svg) installed and available in you path for the full build to work.
If not, some icons set (Cisco, Fortinet) will not be generated and avaialable.
You can find the build script in the [tools folder](./tools/build.ps1)

```
cd ./tools/
pwsh ./build.ps1
```

Additional arguments can be passed to the script to only run parts of the build process, refer to the script for more information.
